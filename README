There are three Android applications required to allow GreenGPS 
to run continuously in a testbed environment.

1. GreenGPS: the application that collects/stores/uploads data
2. AppMonitor: the service that checks on GreenGPS every 10 minutes
	to make sure it hasn't been killed randomly by memory management
3. SystemStability: the service that restarts the phone everyday
	some time between midnight and 1:00 am to refresh the OS

To test the GreenGPS application, you may use the script inside 
GreenGPS-Test to simulate a car engine on your laptop.

The makefiles were written for the latest Android SDK
