========== OBD_SERVER ==========

You will need to install PyBluez and maybe even LightBlue 
(do a search with the synaptic package manager)

All the data outputted by this script is junk! 
Use for testing GreenGPS without a car.

========= INSTRUCTIONS =========

1. Connect your phone to a power source

2. Pair your laptop with your phone. To be safe, make sure
the phone only has one paired device (your laptop)

3. Start the OBD-II server

	$ python obd_server.py

4. Start GreenGPS on your phone. Watch the fake data fly by

NOTE1: on first start, GreenGPS will destroy the GUI and leave
a singleton thread running in the background. Press the app 
icon again to see some log output on the screen.

NOTE2: initializing GPS and Bluetooth takes time. If you see
a dialog asking whether you would like to Force Quit or Wait,
select Wait.
